## Code Breakdown

The first code in this repo is the C code that displays two messages simultaneously, the code displays the messages, shifts their positions a bit and then displays them again in reversed and continues the cycle for a while.

When the user pushes the "right" button, he/she get's access to a screen that allows them to change either the first or second message or both and then return to the normal cycle.


The second code in this repo is writte in assembly and does the same as the first one except, pushing the button changes the speed the texts move in.
